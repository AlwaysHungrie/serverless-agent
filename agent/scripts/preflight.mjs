/**
 * Refuse to deploy a Worker that would come up unguarded, or unconfigured.
 *   node scripts/preflight.mjs [--env <name>]
 *
 * Unconfigured means the deployment settings: the Worker ships no ceilings or defaults
 * of its own and refuses every request until each one is set, so a deploy onto an
 * incomplete document is a deploy onto a Worker that answers nothing. The check is the
 * admin CLI's own (`admin-cli check`), against the live deployment.
 *
 * Runs ahead of `wrangler deploy`, because the version that matters is the one that
 * is already live. The Worker itself also refuses to serve without `API_SECRET` — see
 * `unconfigured()` in src/server.ts — so a deploy that slipped past this would fail
 * closed rather than open. This is the earlier and friendlier of the two: it says what
 * is missing before the broken version is the one answering.
 *
 * Secrets are not readable, only listable, which is all this needs: the question is
 * whether one is set, never what it is.

/**
 * Tests run inside workerd, not Node.
 *
 * This is the only way the suite can mean anything here. Almost everything worth
 * testing in this Worker is a Durable Object holding its own SQLite: the migration
 * ladder, the access checks, the agent ceiling, the session index. Mocking that away
 * would leave tests that pass against a fake and say nothing about the thing that
 * ships. `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` runs each test file in the real runtime,
 * with the real bindings from wrangler.jsonc — real DO storage, real SQL, real
 * `crypto.subtle` — so a test that passes here is a statement about production.
 *
 * Storage is not rolled back between tests in this version of the pool, so tests make
 * their own accounts and agents rather than sharing fixtures.

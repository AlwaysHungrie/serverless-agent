/**
 * Turning a Clerk session token into an email address the Worker can act on.

 * SDK, so the only thing it can check for itself is the signature on the session
 * token. That is what this module does: fetch the issuer's public keys, verify the
 * token against them, and hand back the address in its claims. A forged identity
 * then needs Clerk's private key rather than a leaked environment variable.
 *
 * Two caches sit in front of all of it, because this runs on every message, every
 * stream frame and every thumbnail, and an isolate that re-fetched a key set or
 * re-checked a signature each time would spend more on authentication than on the
 * work being authenticated.

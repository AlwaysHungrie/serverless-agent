 *
 * The shape of this module deliberately mirrors `telegram.ts` — a transport class
 * plus pure helpers — so the two channels stay comparable. Where they differ, they
 * differ because Meta does:
 *
 * - Every delivery is signed. Telegram hands back a secret header this Worker chose;
 *   Meta signs the raw body with the app secret, so the body has to be read as text
 *   and verified before it is parsed.
 * - Deliveries repeat. Meta re-sends anything that is not answered with a fast 200,
 *   and the same message id arrives again. Telegram needs no dedupe; this does.
 * - A business may only send free-form text inside 24 hours of the user's last
 *   message. Outside that window Graph refuses with error 131047 and only a
 *   pre-approved template will go through.

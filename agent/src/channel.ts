/**
 * A chat channel, as a turn sees one.
 *
 * Telegram and WhatsApp are different wires — a bot token against the Bot API, a
 * system-user token against Graph; a chat id and a topic, a phone number and a
 * `wamid`; JSON in one place, multipart in another. What a turn does with them is the
 * same eight steps in the same order: look busy, answer a command, check the spend,
 * take in whatever came attached, run, reply, send what was drawn, apologise if it
 * broke.
 *
 * Those eight steps used to exist twice, once per channel, which is why the two drifted:
 * Telegram could send a drawn image and WhatsApp could not, WhatsApp could send a voice
 * note and Telegram could not, and each new feature had to pick a channel to be born on.
 * This module is the seam that ends that. A channel is a small object; the turn loop in
 * `agent.ts` holds the steps; and what a channel cannot do it simply does not implement,
 * so `channel.sendVoice` being absent is the whole of "this channel has no voice notes".
 *
 * Nothing here knows about sessions, turns or the model. It is the transports plus the
 * shape the turn loop wants them in.

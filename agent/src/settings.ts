/**
 * The deployment's own knobs: every ceiling this Worker enforces, and every value an
 * agent starts out holding, in one document the owner can change without a deploy.
 *
 * Why a document and not constants. A ceiling is a decision about a deployment, not
 * about the code — the same Worker runs a demo where 20 sessions is generous and a
 * business account where 256 is tight.
 *
 * Why there is no fallback. This Worker ships with no values of its own: every field
 * has to be in the stored document, and a deployment missing any of them refuses to
 * serve (see `SettingsIncompleteError`) until the owner sets it. The values a fresh
 * deployment starts from ship with the admin CLI (`admin-cli/defaults.json`), which
 * writes them here — so the number in force is always one somebody wrote down for
 * this deployment, never one the code decided on its behalf.
 *
 * Why `0` is not "absent". Several of these are legitimately zero (`max_tokens: 0` is
 * "no cap"), so absence has to be key-not-present rather than a sentinel.
 *
 * Secrets are deliberately not here. An OpenRouter key, a bot token and a Meta app
 * secret belong to one agent and are billed to it; a deployment-wide default for one
 * would be a deployment-wide key, which is the thing `openrouter_api_key` exists to
 * prevent. `config_defaults` is restricted to `SETTABLE_CONFIG_KEYS` for that reason.

/**
 * Stop an agent page drawing for somebody who is not signed in.
 *
 * Middleware used to do this. It no longer can: the second way to be somebody here is
 * the localStorage back door, which middleware cannot see — a page navigation carries
 * no headers of ours — so protecting routes there would bounce every impersonated
 * visitor to a sign-in screen they have no use for. The check moved here, where the
 * browser is known.
 *
 * It says so and waits. Nothing redirects: a page that navigates away on its own takes
 * the explanation with it, and the way out is a button that was always going to be
 * faster to read than to be surprised by.
 *
 * This is for the visitor, not for the data. Nothing on these pages is theirs to see
 * either way: every byte arrives from a route handler that forwards to the Worker, and
 * the Worker answers nobody it cannot identify and shows no agent to an address that is
 * not on its list. What this prevents is a blank frame full of failed requests where a
 * way in should be.
